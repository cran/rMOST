Description: Estimates Pareto-optimal solution for personnel selection
    with 3 objectives using Normal Boundary Intersection (NBI) algorithm
    introduced by Das and Dennis (1998) <doi:10.1137/S1052623496307510>.
    Takes predictor intercorrelations and predictor-objective relations as
    input and generates a series of solutions containing predictor weights
    as output. Accepts between 3 and 10 selection predictors. Maximum 2
    objectives could be adverse impact objectives. Partially modeled after
    De Corte (2006) TROFSS Fortran program
    <https://users.ugent.be/~wdecorte/trofss.pdf> and updated from
    'ParetoR' package described in Song et al. (2017)
    <doi:10.1037/apl0000240>. For details, see Song et al. (in press).
